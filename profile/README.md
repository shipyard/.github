Welcome to Shipyard’s official GitHub! Here we offer some resources to help you get started with your deployments. For more information, [check out our docs.](https://docs.shipyard.build/docs)

## What’s Shipyard?

Shipyard is an **Environment Management** platform for developers and their agents. It creates ephemeral, on-demand copies of your app every time you open a PR. You can share these environments with SSO-enabled links, run E2E and unit tests against them, use them in agentic workflows, and integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline. With Shipyard, all you'll need to start deploying environments is a **Docker Compose** file.

## What’s an ephemeral environment?

Ephemeral environments are full-stack, production-like copies of your app. You're able to spin them up automatically when opening a new PR, and spin them down when you no longer need them. Ephemeral environments are an industry best practice when building and testing during pre-production.
